# File Format Selection

## Question
Which file format should you use? Why?

## Answer
I should use the **CSV** format because my dataset is tabular, containing clear rows and columns (essays and labels). CSV is simple, lightweight, and compatible with spreadsheet tools and Python libraries like pandas, which makes data analysis and visualization easier.
